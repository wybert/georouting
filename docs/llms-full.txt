[![image](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/wybert/georouting/blob/main/docs/usage.ipynb)



```python
pip install georouting
```

## Prepare some data


```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wybert/georouting/main/docs/data/sample_3.csv",
    index_col=0)
data = data[['ZIP_lat', 'ZIP_lon', 'AHA_ID_lat', 'AHA_ID_lon']]
data.head()
```




|  | ZIP_lat | ZIP_lon | AHA_ID_lat | AHA_ID_lon |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6010 | 42.376239 | -72.605400 | 42.819978 | -73.916518 |
| 5333 | 42.293923 | -72.967189 | 41.753841 | -72.682788 |
| 7678 | 42.158520 | -72.585325 | 40.709320 | -74.212500 |




```python
origin = [data.iloc[2]["ZIP_lat"],data.iloc[2]["ZIP_lon"]]
destination = [data.iloc[2]["AHA_ID_lat"],data.iloc[2]["AHA_ID_lon"]]

origins = data[['ZIP_lat', 'ZIP_lon']].values.tolist()
destinations = data[['AHA_ID_lat', 'AHA_ID_lon']].values.tolist()
```

## Get a route use OSRM 

Get a route between two points is easy, 


```python
from georouting.routers import OSRMRouter
# create a router object 
router = OSRMRouter(mode="driving")
# get the route between the origin and destination, this will return a Route object
# this will call the OSRM API
route = router.get_route(origin, destination)
# Now you can get the distance and duration of the route in meters and seconds
print("Distance: {} meters".format(route.get_distance()))
print("Duration: {} seconds".format(route.get_duration()))
```

    Distance: 268234.5 meters
    Duration: 12313.4 seconds


You can easily get the distance, duration.

You can also return the routing results in a GeoDataFrame, It will return the distance, duration, speed and the route geometry,


```python
df= route.get_route_geopandas()
df.head()
```




|  | geometry | duration (s) | distance (m) | speed (m/s) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | LINESTRING (-72.58532 42.15852, -72.58523 42.1... | 22.6 | 279.5 | 12.367257 |
| 1 | LINESTRING (-72.58194 42.15850, -72.58194 42.1... | 12.3 | 163.2 | 13.268293 |
| 2 | LINESTRING (-72.58090 42.15734, -72.58092 42.1... | 128.2 | 1929.9 | 15.053822 |
| 3 | LINESTRING (-72.58196 42.14028, -72.58205 42.1... | 111.8 | 1703.5 | 15.237030 |
| 4 | LINESTRING (-72.58437 42.12533, -72.58492 42.1... | 98.1 | 1783.3 | 18.178389 |



You can visualize the route in a map,


```python
route.plot_route()
```




*[Interactive map - view in Jupyter notebook]*



## Get a distance matrix


```python
distance_matrix = router.get_distance_matrix(origins, destinations, append_od=True)
distance_matrix.head()
```




|  | orgin_lat | orgin_lon | destination_lat | destination_lon | distance (m) | duration (s) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 42.376239 | -72.605400 | 42.819978 | -73.916518 | 185141.8 | 8639.8 |
| 1 | 42.376239 | -72.605400 | 41.753841 | -72.682788 | 82634.6 | 4058.1 |
| 2 | 42.376239 | -72.605400 | 40.709320 | -74.212500 | 300008.0 | 13819.9 |
| 3 | 42.293923 | -72.967189 | 42.819978 | -73.916518 | 126934.5 | 6829.4 |
| 4 | 42.293923 | -72.967189 | 41.753841 | -72.682788 | 90821.8 | 5550.6 |



## Get distances according OD pairs

Sometimes you may want to get the durations and distances for some specific origin-destination pairs not for all possible combinations between them. you can use the `get_distances_batch` function. 


```python
distances = router.get_distances_batch(origins, destinations, append_od=True)
distances
```




|  | origin_lat | origin_lon | destination_lat | destination_lon | distance (m) | duration (s) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 42.376239 | -72.605400 | 42.819978 | -73.916518 | 185141.8 | 8639.8 |
| 0 | 42.293923 | -72.967189 | 41.753841 | -72.682788 | 90821.8 | 5550.6 |
| 0 | 42.158520 | -72.585325 | 40.709320 | -74.212500 | 268234.5 | 12313.4 |



It will automatically split the OD pairs into batches and get the distance matrix for each batch to avoid the API limit.

## What's more

`georouting` provides a unified API for routing services, you can use the similar code to get the routing results from different routing services like Google Maps, Bing Maps, OSRM, etc.

<a id="georouting.routers.bing.BingRouter.get_distance_matrix"></a>

#### get\_distance\_matrix

```python
def get_distance_matrix(origins, destinations, append_od=False)
```

This method returns a Pandas dataframe representing a distance matrix between the `origins` and `destinations` points. It returns the duration and distance for
all possible combinations between each origin and each destination. If you want just
return the duration and distance for specific origin-destination pairs, use the `get_distances_batch` method.

If the `append_od` parameter is set to True, the method also returns a matrix of origin-destination pairs.

The Bing Maps API has the following limitations for distance matrix requests,
for more information see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/rest-services/routes/calculate-a-distance-matrix#api-limits):

- For travel mode driving a distance matrix that has up to 2,500 origins-destinations pairs can be requested for Basic Bing Maps accounts,
- while for Enterprise Bing Maps accounts the origin-destination pairs limit is 10,000.
- For travel mode transit and walking, a distance matrix that has up to 650 origins-destinations pairs can be request for all Bing Maps account types.

Pairs are calculated by multiplying the number of origins, by the number of destinations.
For example 10,000 origin-destination pairs can be reached if you have: 1 origin, and 10,000 destinations,
or 100 origins and 100 destinations defined in your request.


Parameters
----------
- `origins` : iterable objects
    An iterable object containing the origin points. It can be a list of tuples, a list of lists, a list of arrays, etc.

The class BaseRouter serves as a base class for routers, which are used to compute the optimal route between two points. The class has an instance variable mode, which is a string that defines the mode of transportation (e.g. "driving").

The BaseRouter class has a single method _get_OD_matrix, which takes two arguments origins and destinations and returns an origin-destination matrix. The method creates an empty list items and loops through each origin and destination pair, appending the concatenated origin and destination to the list. The origin-destination matrix is then created from the list items and returned.

<a id="georouting.routers.base.BaseRouter.get_distances_batch"></a>

#### get\_distances\_batch

```python
def get_distances_batch(origins,
                        destinations,
                        max_batch_size=25,
                        append_od=False)
```

This method returns a Pandas dataframe contains duration and disatnce for all the `origins` and `destinations` pairs. Use this function if you don't want to get duration and distance for all possible combinations between each origin and each destination.

The origins and destinations parameters are lists of origin-destination pairs. They should be the same length.

If the `append_od` parameter is set to True, the method also returns the input origin-destination pairs.

<a id="georouting.routers.base.WebRouter"></a>

## WebRouter Objects

```python
class WebRouter(BaseRouter)
```

The WebRouter class is a class for handling a route obtained from a web-based routing service.

1.  Fork the georouting repo on GitHub.

2.  Clone your fork locally:

    ```shell
    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/georouting.git
    ```

3.  Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have
    virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for
    local development:

    ```shell
    $ mkvirtualenv georouting
    $ cd georouting/
    $ python setup.py develop
    ```

    ```shell
    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

    Now you can make your changes locally.

5.  When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8
    and the tests, including testing other Python versions with tox:

    ```shell
    $ flake8 georouting tests
    $ python setup.py test or pytest
    $ tox
    ```

    To get flake8 and tox, just pip install them into your virtualenv.

6.  Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

    ```shell
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

7.  Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1.  The pull request should include tests.
2.  If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
    Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add
    the feature to the list in README.rst.
3.  The pull request should work for Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8, and
    for PyPy. Check <https://github.com/wybert/georouting/pull_requests> and make sure that the tests pass for all
    supported Python versions.
