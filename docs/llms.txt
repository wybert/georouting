# Georouting

> A Python routing library providing a unified API across multiple routing services including Google Maps, Bing Maps, OSRM, ESRI, OSMnx, and pgRouting.

Georouting abstracts away the differences between routing backends and provides a consistent interface for computing routes, calculating distance matrices, and visualizing routing results.


## Installation

not work with python 3.14 yet, use python 3.6-3.13

```bash
pip install georouting
```

or
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/wybert/georouting.git
```

or via conda:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge georouting
```
## Quick Start

```python
from georouting.routers import OSRMRouter

# Create a router (OSRM requires no API key)
router = OSRMRouter(mode="driving")

# Define origin and destination as [latitude, longitude]
origin = [42.3601, -71.0589]      # Boston
destination = [40.7128, -74.0060]  # New York

# Get route
route = router.get_route(origin, destination)
print(f"Distance: {route.get_distance()} meters")
print(f"Duration: {route.get_duration()} seconds")

# Get route as GeoDataFrame
gdf = route.get_route_geopandas()

# Visualize route on interactive map
route.plot_route()

# Calculate distance matrix for multiple points
origins = [[42.3601, -71.0589], [41.8781, -87.6298]]
destinations = [[40.7128, -74.0060], [34.0522, -118.2437]]
matrix = router.get_distance_matrix(origins, destinations)
print(matrix)
```


## Features

- Support most of the routing services, including Google Maps, Bing Maps, OSRM, etc.
- Provide a unified API for routing services
- Support calculating the travel distance matrix between multiple origins and destinations
- Support calculating the travel distance according to OD pairs.
- Easy to visualize the routing results
- Return the travel distance matrix in a Pandas `Dataframe` you like
- Return the routing results in a Geopandas `GeoDataFrame`
- Easy to extend to support more routing services
