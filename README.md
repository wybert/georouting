**Geo routing for Python users**

Warning!!! This project is under active development, the API may change in the future. Wait for the release of version 1.0.0. This package is inspired by [geopy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Please help to improve this package by submitting issues and pull requests.

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/wybert/georouting.git
``` 
It will be on pypi soon.
## Usage

```python

# how to get routing distance matrix from OSRMRouter
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wybert/georouting/main/docs/data/sample_3.csv",index_col=0)
one_od_pair = data.iloc[2]
data.head()

from georouting.routers import GoogleRouter
# create a router object with the google_key
router = GoogleRouter(google_key,mode="driving")
# get the route between the origin and destination, this will return a Route object
# this will call the Google Maps API
route = router.get_route([one_od_pair["ZIP_lat"],one_od_pair["ZIP_lon"]],
                           [one_od_pair["AHA_ID_lat"],one_od_pair["AHA_ID_lon"]])
# Now you can get the distance and duration of the route in meters and seconds
print("Distance: {} meters".format(route.get_distance()))
print("Duration: {} seconds".format(route.get_duration()))

df= route.get_route_geopandas()
df.head()

df.explore(column="speed (m/s)",style_kwds={"weight":11,"opacity":0.8})

```


## Features

- Support most of the routing services, including Google Maps, Bing Maps, OSRM, etc.
- Provide a unified API for routing services
- Support calculating the travel distance matrix between multiple origins and destinations
- Return the travel distance matrix in a Pandas `Dataframe` you like
- Return the routing results in a Geopandas `GeoDataFrame`
- Easy to extend to support more routing services
